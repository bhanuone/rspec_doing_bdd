# Likes and Dislikes of BDD using Rspec
## Likes
1. Rspec provides a human readable DSL and matchers to write behavior specifications
2. Helps us write tests independent of implementation of features/modules
3. Since it is written from user stories, it serves as reference documentation for everyone
4. Helps us find which application is broken when new features are added to the application

## Dislikes
1. Increases development time
